### Hello There
Welcome to my personal Github page
### About Me
My name is Devin Clark and I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at [New Relic](https://newrelic.com). I have been there for nearly 9 years, working on many different internal systems for them built in Ruby. I have been programming in Ruby and Rails professionally for the last 13 years. 
### About What's Here
Since I have spent most of my professional career working for companies where I can not show what I have been working on, a lot of what you will find here will be results from tutorials I have completed. In my spare time, I have been branching out into Elixir and Phoenix, as well as Java, Python and Machine Learning. Below you will find some of my more recent Java and Python projects from [HyperSkill](https://hyperskill.org).
